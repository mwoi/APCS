Questions
==============================================================
Activity 1: Data, Data, Data!
==============================================================
1. ESPN, Piazza, Google Classroom

    that there can be multiple types of data in one data file.
4. By seeing what type of data is being stored (if they are all integers, you are probably
    storing integer data).
5.
6.
7.
