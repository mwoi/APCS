# Roster
Team Slightly Under-ripe Bananas (Joshua Yagupsky, Marcus Wu, Ivina Wang)

## Our experience
The lab took far longer than expected, mostly because the directions were a bit difficult to understand at times. We had to rewrite the fake review method several times
before we found out about the ``` String.split(String) ``` method, which was immeasureably helpful. Acitivity 5 seemed a bit out of place compared to the rest of the lab.
