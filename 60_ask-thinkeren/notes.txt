HW#60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle

time spent: .5 hrs

DISCO:
* Although we seemed to be improving towards the end, the major problem was that people were
 confused about who to give the cards to. Others were confused who gave them the cards in the
 first place.
* To make the algorithm simpler, it is best to set the base case to one card- because we know that
 the card will always be sorted

QCC:
* What is an efficient way to keep track of who has already received a card/who hasn't?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
1. Wait until you receive cards from another person.
2. If you receive only one card, return it to the person who gave it to you
  (they will be standing up with their arms pointing towards you.)
3. Otherwise, cut the deck in half. Find two neighbors with no cards, give each half of the deck,
  and stand up with your arms pointing towards them.
4. When you receive the two piles of cards from your neighbors, MERGE them.
5. Give this new pile to the person who gave you the original pile.

How to MERGE two piles:
1. Have each pile with cards face up. Don't look at any other cards besides the top cards.
2. Place the card with greater value upside down between the two piles.
3. Repeatedly place the card with greater value on top of the upside-down pile until no more cards are left.
