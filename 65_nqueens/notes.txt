HW65 -- How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...
2022-02-16
time spent: 1 hr

Notes:
- There are two print methods, printSolution() and a toString()
printSolution prints out whether the box has a Queen, and if not, it prints out "-"
toString () only prints out the arrays, which contains 0, -1, -2, etc.
- The algorithm works by placing queens in a left to right, top to bottom order. After placing a queen in a column,
we repeatedly move over one column and place another queen in a valid location. If there are no valid locations, we go back a column and
move the queen to the next valid spot.
